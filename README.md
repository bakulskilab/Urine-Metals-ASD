# Exposure to heavy metals in utero and autism spectrum disorder at age 3: A meta-analysis of two enriched-risk cohorts

**Background**: Autism spectrum disorder is a prevalent and heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder. Risk is attributed to genetic and prenatal environmental factors, though the environmental agents are incompletely characterized. 

**Methods**: In the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk in Babies Learning Early Signs (MARBLES), two enriched-risk pregnancy cohorts, maternal urinary metals concentrations at two time points during pregnancy were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. At age three, clinicians assessed autism spectrum disorder with DSM-5 criteria. Using multivariable log binomial regression, we tested each metal for association with autism spectrum disorder status, adjusting for gestational age, child sex, and maternal education, and meta-analyzed results across the two cohorts.

**Results**: In EARLI (n=175) 18.3% of children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, and 43.4% had non-neurotypical development. In MARBLES (n=170), 22.9% were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, while 12.4% had non-neurotypical development. In early pregnancy, having cadmium concentration over the level of detection was associated with 1.83 (1.24, 2.70) times higher risk of autism spectrum disorder, and 1.50 (1.12, 2.0) times higher risk of non-neurotypical development. A doubling of cesium concentration was marginally associated with 1.59 (0.93, 2.73) times higher risk of autism diagnosis. A doubling of selenium concentration was associated with 0.90 times lower risk of autism diagnosis. 

**Conclusion**: Exposure in utero to elevated metals levels (cesium, cadmium), as measured via maternal urine, was associated with increased odds of developing autism spectrum disorder. Prenatal timing of exposure and longitudinal clinical evaluations are critical.
